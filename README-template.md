## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - Tailwindcss

### What I learned

- Create a component from scratch using React JS and styling seperated components with all CSS using utilities classes first approach;
- Using third-party react's state management to handle the state of interactive button
- Using conditional react's to selective openning a modal component
- Applying typescript for a safety checking and consistent of react's types

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
import { atom } from "jotai";

export const modalAtom = atom<boolean>(false);
export const rateAtom = atom<string>('');
...

const isShow = useAtomValue(modalAtom);
const [rate] = useAtomValue(rateAtom);
```

### Continued development

- I am going to keep trying to have a good grasp of using Tailwinds class in advanced projects.
- Striving to optimizing the react's state flow throught the re-renders and decrease the javascript bundlesize by using effective external data fetching features in the future projects.
